# Retro Fantasy House Style

Produce assets that feel like a polished late-90s action RPG with modern clarity.

Style rules:

- Crisp pixel readability first: silhouettes must remain clear at 64px previews.
- Use value grouping to separate gameplay-important forms from decoration.
- Keep edges intentional: avoid blurry antialiasing and muddy gradients.
- Favor handcrafted cluster shading over airbrushed softness.
- Highlight materials clearly: steel, leather, wood, stone, cloth, and arcane glass should read instantly.
- Keep perspective consistent with top-down gameplay assets.

Color and lighting:

- Warm key lights from torches/lanterns with cool ambient shadows.
- Accent magic effects with cyan, violet-blue, and ember orange.
- Preserve contrast in midtones; avoid crushed blacks.

Output constraints:

- No watermark, no logos, no embedded text.
- Keep composition production-ready for game runtime use.
