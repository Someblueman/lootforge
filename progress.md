Original prompt: Could you help implement the provided plan by creating a new branch first and building a playable Phaser demo at examples/phaser-demo that consumes 100% generated-and-committed pipeline assets, adds demo asset scripts/tests/docs, and supports a reliable web-game verification loop.

- 2026-02-15: Started task on branch feat/phaser-demo-generated-assets.
- Loaded skills: codex-compound-workflow and develop-web-game.
- Compound memory reuse check: no existing lootforge repo memory directory found.
- Next: scaffold demo app, generated asset contract files, tests, and docs.
- Added new Phaser demo scaffold under examples/phaser-demo with BootScene/ArenaScene/systems/Hud/AssetRegistry.
- Added deterministic hooks (`window.render_game_to_text`, `window.advanceTime`) in ArenaScene.
- Added root scripts for demo build/dev/test + asset plan/generate/atlas/postprocess.
- Expanded pipeline target metadata propagation and atlas fallback bundle generation when TexturePacker is unavailable.
- Added demo smoke/contract tests under test/demo.
- Ran demo asset pipeline with OpenAI and committed 9 generated PNGs + atlas/catalog manifests in examples/phaser-demo/public/assets.
- Added generation progress logging (prepare + per-target start/finish/error) for CLI transparency.
- Added demo README and demo tests (`npm run demo:test` currently passing).
- Verified Playwright loop using develop-web-game client on dedicated port 5180 (to avoid a separate service on 5173).
- Added arrow-key movement and Enter/Space restart aliases to support automated input bursts.
- Fixed demo Vite root resolution bug so the new app is served from examples/phaser-demo, not repo root.
- Fixed fallback atlas frame sizing (use acceptance/image dimensions, not runtime preview dimensions) to prevent cropped/invisible sprites.
- Captured gameplay screenshot at examples/phaser-demo/docs/gameplay.png.
- Validation run status:
  - npm run demo:build ✅
  - npm run demo:test ✅
  - npm test ✅
  - npm run typecheck ✅
  - npm run build ✅
- TODO: if this demo is promoted publicly, consider adding true packed atlases via TexturePacker in CI for tighter runtime payloads.
- Added CLI generation progress logging and validated output format by running a 1-target generate command.
- Additional gameplay verification via Playwright action bursts:
  - movement + shooting + score/kills progression
  - game over transition
  - restart via Enter (automation-friendly alias)
- Final regression checks rerun after latest edits:
  - npm run demo:test ✅
  - npm run test ✅
  - npm run build ✅
- Follow-up quality pass from user feedback:
  - switched controls to explicit `keyboard.addKey` bindings (W/A/S/D + arrows + restart aliases)
  - rebalanced runtime sprite sizes (player/enemy/projectile/effect/UI) for better proportions
  - strengthened manifest prompts for top-down readability and transparent-background constraints
  - regenerated full demo asset set and rebuilt atlas/catalog outputs
- Verification probes after the fix:
  - left movement with `A` key: player x 480 -> 376 ✅
  - downward movement with arrow down: player y 270 -> 377.7 ✅
  - right movement with arrow right: player x 480 -> 584 ✅
- Refreshed gameplay screenshot at examples/phaser-demo/docs/gameplay.png.
