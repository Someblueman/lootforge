Current scope: rewrite LootForge for the strongest asset-generation pipeline outcome.

- 2026-02-16: Completed migration to `next` manifest flow with strict `generate -> process -> atlas -> eval -> review -> select -> package` stages.
- 2026-02-16: Removed all playable runtime/demo scaffolding from the repository so focus is fully on asset outputs and quality gates.
- 2026-02-16: Verified repository health after removal:
  - `npm run typecheck` ✅
  - `npm test` ✅
  - `npm run build` ✅
- 2026-02-17: Added versioned public release roadmap (`docs/ROADMAP.md`) covering `0.2.0` through `1.0.0`.
- 2026-02-17: Added roadmap gap audit + explicit `Upcoming`/`Future` release queues to support public release planning.
- 2026-02-17: Added multi-runtime packaging transpiler foundation (`phaser` baseline + optional `pixi`/`unity` manifests) and documented engine targeting strategy in `docs/ENGINE_TARGETING.md`.
- 2026-02-18: Added GitHub Actions CI for PR/push validation (`typecheck`, `test`, `build`) plus security workflows (`dependency-review`, `npm audit`, `CodeQL`).
- 2026-02-18: Picked up the next `0.2.0` roadmap item by auto-ingesting `styleKits[].palettePath` defaults into normalized target palette policy when `target.palette` is unset.
- 2026-02-18: Extended review HTML with per-target score-component detail blocks for eval/review explainability parity.
- 2026-02-18: Implemented `lootforge regenerate --edit` command flow that uses approved selection-lock outputs as edit bases and carries regeneration source metadata into run provenance.
- 2026-02-18: Converted `docs/ROADMAP.md` to a release-only roadmap (no separate gap-audit section), with all remaining work tracked directly in `0.2.0`/`0.3.0`/`0.4.0`/`0.5.0`/`1.0.0` queues.
- 2026-02-19: Implemented `0.3.0` pack-level invariants and spritesheet continuity gates (manifest hard-gates, normalized target propagation, acceptance/eval/review reporting, and stage-artifact contract support).
- 2026-02-19: Added coverage for strict eval failure and select approval propagation from pack-level hard errors, plus contract/review tests for optional `packInvariants` summaries.
- 2026-02-20: Added canonical generation request contract endpoint (`POST /v1/generation/requests`) plus mapping layer from service requests to `plan -> generate` pipeline targets.
- 2026-02-20: Implemented optional service mode (`lootforge serve`) with stable HTTP `v1` command endpoints and discovery metadata for MCP wrapper compatibility.
- 2026-02-20: Implemented Nano/Gemini edit-first parity for image-capable models with safe edit-input path handling and provider-level tests.
- 2026-02-20: Implemented first-class post-process semantics for smart-crop/pixel-perfect controls and explicit processed `raw`/`style_ref`/`pixel` artifact variants.
- 2026-02-20: Added directed-synthesis manifest scaffolding for `controlImage/controlMode`, style-kit `styleReferenceImages` + `loraPath/loraStrength`, and `generationPolicy.highQuality/hiresFix` propagation into planned targets/contracts.
- 2026-02-20: Added provider capability introspection contract + endpoint (`/v1/contracts/provider-capabilities`, `/v1/providers/capabilities`) with explicit `pixel`/`highRes`/`references` feature-gating signals for wrappers.
